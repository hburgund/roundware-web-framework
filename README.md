# RoundwareJS

## Introduction

[Roundware](http://roundware.org/) is a location-based contributory audio platform. This framework provides a JavaScript SDK for interacting with the [Roundware Server API](https://github.com/roundware/roundware-server). The goal is to enable the creation of browser-based contributory audio and audio augmented reality applications.

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.

## Development

You can use webpack to live-reload source code by running this command in the project:

```bash
npm devstart
```

The test suite can be executed like this:

```bash
npm test # run test suite
ROUNDWARE_DEBUG=true npm test # pipe logging statements to the console
```
